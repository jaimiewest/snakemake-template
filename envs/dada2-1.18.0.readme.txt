N.B. specification of r-matrix=1.3-2 here

r-matrix=1.3-3 is loaded by default if not specified, but there is some issue that causes problems when dada2 calls functions from the package

apparently this issue will be fixed in the next version of dada2 (v 1.19?), by removing the dependency on r-matrix, but this version is not yet available through conda

consider upgrading to dada2 v1.19 and removing specification of r-matrix when it is available
